CONTENT CHANGES

The TeamMentor 3.4.1 release includes the following content changes:

Vulnerability Library Update

A number of articles to the new Vulnerability library has been added to aid integration with code vulnerability scanners. A vulnerability type article directs the user to the guidance for implementing the relevant countermeasures and course materials for background information. The Vulnerability pages are designed to be used from a code scanner, but can be used independently. The Vulnerability library currently has 221 articles and it is growing rapidly.

.NET 2.0 Library Update

921 items have been removed to optimize the reading experience.
Previous versions include "Question and Answer" type articles that are essentially the same in function as "Checklist Item" type articles. Additionally, many "Checklist Item" type articles were nearly identical. The result was that the library was difficult to navigate because of many similar articles. The redundant articles have been removed and the quality of the remaining articles has been improved.
